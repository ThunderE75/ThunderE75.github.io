 This guide demonstrates how i setup my MPV will all the Configs, Scripts & Keybindings. 

## Why MPV 
Like most people, my first real media player was VLC. It was the go-to recommendation: free, open-source, played almost anything, and worked across platforms. But over time, I started noticing cracks. The biggest issue for me was the UI. It hadn’t really changed since the version I used as a kid, and with Windows 11’s modern design language, it felt increasingly out of place. That alone was manageable until I switched to a laptop with an OLED screen. Suddenly, I was hooked on pure black and dark-mode interfaces, and VLC became an eyesore. I tried to fix it. I searched for a decent dark VLC skin but couldn’t find one. I even installed the beta branch that had a redesigned UI with dark mode support. Unfortunately, it was sluggish and borderline unusable, so I rolled back to the stable release. Then the performance issues started to bother me: slow opening and closing times, occasional jittery playback on high-quality videos, lag when scrubbing through the timeline, and no thumbnail previews. That’s when I finally decided to look for a better player—and that search led me to MPV.

At first, I was disappointed. MPV’s default UI felt primitive, almost too barebones, and I continued my hunt for alternatives. But nothing else stood out. Eventually, I gave up and stuck with what I had. Then, one day while browsing {{< linkicon "https://reddit.com/r/unixporn" "fa-brands fa-reddit" "r/unixporn" >}} I came across someone’s MPV setup. It looked nothing like the plain MPV I had tried before. Curious, I checked out their dotfiles and discovered that MPV was fully configurable through its own config files. Not long after, I stumbled upon {{< linkicon "https://github.com/stax76/awesome-mpv" "fa-brands fa-github" "stax76/awesome-mpv" >}} which is a curated list of scripts, OSC, forks, shaders & other tools build by the community for MPV. I have spent countless hours tweaking scripts, keybinds, and settings, slowly turning MPV into exactly the player I wanted. And I couldn’t be happier without it.

This was setup on `Windows`, so some changes might be necessary (Like File paths & CLI commands) to make it work on Linux/MacOS.

### Amazing mpv forks
MPV itself is great, but the ecosystem around it makes it even more exciting:
- {{< linkicon "https://github.com/iina/iina" "fa-brands fa-github" "IINA" >}}(macOS) - A beautifully designed MPV frontend that feels like a native Mac app.
